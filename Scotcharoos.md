Received from BGiles

## Ingredients
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 cup corn syrup
- 1 cup peanut butter
- 6 cups puffed rice cereal
- 1 cup milk chocolate morsels
- ¾ cup butterscotch morsels

## Instructions
Line a 9x13" baking dish with parchment paper
Combine sugar and corn syrup in a pot over medium-high heat. Stir and bring mixture to a small boil for just 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in peanut butter until smooth.

Pour peanut butter mixture over puffed rice cereal in a large bowl and stir to coat. Transfer coated cereal to the prepared baking dish and gently press to an even layer.

Meanwhile combine milk chocolate chips and butterscotch chips in a microwaveable safe dish and heat in 30 second increments, stirring in between, until mixture is smooth. Pour over cereal and spread evenly.

Let bars cool completely and let chocolate set before lifting the edges of parchment up and out of baking dish and slicing. Keep stored in an airtight container on counter top for up to 7 days. Enjoy!

## Tips For Making Scotcharoos

These bars are meant to be more dense than a classic rice krispie treat, but not rock hard. If you’re finding that your bars are too hard it’s likely because you overcooked the sugar mixture.

Cook the sugar and corn syrup for just 1 minute after it reaches a soft boil.

Gently press the mixture into the casserole dish. If you press too hard it’ll compact and be tough to bite.

Lining the pan with parchment paper makes it easy to remove the bars after they’ve cooled.

Store bars in an air tight container on the countertop so they stay soft to chew.
